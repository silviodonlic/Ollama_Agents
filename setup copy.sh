# The journalctl logs show that PipeWire is attempting to use the "alsa" driver but is unable to find it. This indicates a potential misconfiguration or compatibility issue between PipeWire and ALSA on your system.

# Here’s a structured approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:
# Troubleshooting Steps

#     Verify ALSA Installation:
#         Ensure that ALSA is properly installed on your system. You can reinstall ALSA to make sure all necessary components are present:

#         bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install --reinstall alsa-base alsa-utils

# Check PipeWire Configuration:

    # Verify that PipeWire is properly configured to handle ALSA. The 99-pipewire-default.conf file should configure PipeWire to handle ALSA devices, but it seems PipeWire is not recognizing ALSA. The configuration in /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf should be:

    # plaintext

    pcm.!default {
        type pipewire
        hint {
            show on
            description "Default ALSA Output (PipeWire Sound Server)"
        }
    }

    ctl.!default {
        type pipewire
    }

#     Make sure there are no conflicting configurations in /etc/alsa/conf.d/ or /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/.

# Check for PipeWire and ALSA Integration:

#     Ensure PipeWire is properly integrated with ALSA. You may need to install or configure additional PipeWire modules:

#     bash

sudo apt install pipewire pipewire-audio-client-libraries

# Restart PipeWire and ALSA to apply any changes:

# bash

    systemctl --user restart pipewire
    systemctl --user restart pipewire-pulse
    sudo alsa force-reload

# Verify Bluetooth Configuration:

    # If you are using Bluetooth earbuds, ensure that Bluetooth audio is correctly configured. Check if PipeWire’s Bluetooth module is running:

    # bash

    pactl info | grep "Server Name"

#     Ensure Bluetooth audio is properly handled by PipeWire or PulseAudio, depending on your setup.

# Fallback to PulseAudio:

#     If ALSA is not working correctly with PipeWire, you can temporarily revert to PulseAudio for testing:

#     plaintext

pcm.!default {
    type pulse
    hint {
        show on
        description "Default ALSA Output (currently PulseAudio Sound Server)"
    }
}

ctl.!default {
    type pulse
}

# Restart the relevant services:

# bash

    sudo systemctl restart pulseaudio

# Check Device and Card Availability:

#     Confirm that the ALSA devices and cards are recognized:

#     bash

    aplay -l
    arecord -l

    Ensure that the devices are not muted and are set up correctly in alsamixer.

# Review Logs:

#     Continue to review system logs for additional clues:

#     bash

        journalctl -xe | grep pipewire
        journalctl -xe | grep alsa

# Testing Audio

# After performing these steps, test audio playback and recording:

#     Playback Test:

#     bash

speaker-test -D default -c 2
aplay -D default /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

# Recording Test:

# bash

    arecord -D default -f cd -t wav test.wav

# These steps should help you resolve the issue with ALSA and PipeWire integration, allowing ALSA to use the default configuration as intended. If the issue persists, further investigation into PipeWire's configuration or potential conflicts with other audio systems may be necessary.
